I write hopefully-novel thoughts around machine learning, epistemology, statistics, and programming on [cerebralab.com](https://cerebralab.com). 

My work is now focused on leading the development of [mindsdb](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb) and open-source automatic machine learning tool.

My other open-source projects I have are either WIP or unmaintained. [Let me know](mailto:george@cerebralab.com) if you find any of them useful, and that situation might change.
