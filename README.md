I write hopefully-novel thoughts around machine learning, epistemology, statistics, and programming on [epistem.ink](https://www.epistem.ink). 

Currently working on an [automatic machine learning tool](https://github.com/mindsdb/lightwood).

My other open-source projects I have are either WIP or unmaintained. [Let me know](mailto:george@cerebralab.com) if you find any of them useful, and that situation might change.
